👋 Hiii, my name is Amaiam Ul Haque, just Amaiam (pronouced uh-my-yum) is more than enough!

🌱 I love to take care of plants and always looking for more to bring home!

🍵 I live off of tea and I'm always trying new types!

🪻 I love anything and everything purple 💜

🎮 I enjoy playing video games, especially open-world adventure games.
